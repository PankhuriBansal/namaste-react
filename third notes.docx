react is js librry which fb developers wrote for us 
if we are using react so we are using these codes to make our code fast 
we have window to give access to lots of super powers to browser function  -- js engine gives these super powers 
one way to use react is to use cdn in our code to access React
document.createElement == used to create h1 tag in js 
React.createElement = to create h1 tag in react 
1st arg = tag name
2nd argument = code or attribute 
3rd argument = children 
to run code to production we need to = minify app,clean console,bundle,optimize app, caching also needed
react doe not inforce anything, we can ignite a lot of things, built by open source ignite by open source
we need to use bundlers = webpacks ,parcel, vite == all are bundlers examples 
webpack is the bundler we use in create-react-app...in making our own react app we use the parcel 
create-react-app uses webpack , babel 
parcel is known as a package = package is kind of module , if we need to use package we need a package manager
so we use npm init as a js package manager library but npm doesnt stands for node package manager 
jest command for testing 
we will get package.json when we use init in the app  
npm is used as our react are powered by a lot of things so we need helper packages which comes under npm 
parcel is a xero configuration build tool for Vue 
to get parcel in our app we use (parcel not in production env but our developer env= -D == dev dependency) == npm install -D parcel
dependecny means all packages we need in our project 
after installing parcel we got dev dependency and package-lock.json 
^ = known as caret , ~ = tidle --- way to tell which version are we using for a particular package 
package-lock = to know what exact version do we need to use in production, to know the version of library we are using, it also locks the initial version to avoid any uncertain verions
package-lock also have integrity to ensure which verion of parcel running on local shouldl be there on production as it has the hash 
dont put package-lock.json in gitignore , it locks the current version of anything we are using
node module are kind of db to our whole app, parcel uses a lot of things from node modules
node modules have librarires to minify the data, browser list makes our app compatible in older browsers and more things, basically helper functions
node modules should never be put in github repo as package-lock.json will have sufficient info to regenerate the node modules
npm install react, npm install react-dom
now ignite app with parser = npx parcel index.html (npx - execute using npm ) (index.html will act as an entry point)
never touch node modules or package.json 
gets error as normal js browser does not understands import in App.js, so to fix it we need to tell it is not a normal js file it is a module and will use type
to import we need to tell it is a module not a normal js file 
save file and it automatically reflects in the server == life server done by parcel 
hot module replacement -- hmr -- parcel wil keep a track of any changes in the file 
file watcher algorithm written in c++ -- done by parcel 
while reloading or watching files we need some space it created .parcel-cache and uses these files to work on it's own
npx parcel index.html= created development fix and hosts it on a server
to make a build = npx parcel build index.html and build all the prod files in the dist folder  
all the files in dist folder we get our react and reactdom code 
parcel minifed and bundled our whole code , removing the console logs for us , takes care of all dev and prod differences for us 
images, media all takes lot time to get reload but parcel do images optimization also
par build super fast algorithm, do caching while development, parcel also compresses , also compatible with older versions of browser, it add polyfills
gives us functionality to make app on https = npx parcel index.html --https, also manages the port number 
parcel also manages the port number, parcel.cache should be placed in gitignore because anything which is auto generated can be put inside gitignore
parcel also manages consistent hashing algorithm
react is fast due to virtual dom , it is fast in itself, needs lot of things to make is fast, react uses parcel , parcel acts as a catalyst and a bundler
parcel is a zero config bundler = just install, give entry point and it will figure out everything 
parcel also covers tree shaking == removing unwanted code 
react is pm modi == parcel is amit shah , react need help of everything is work in a together mode 
this is known as transitive dependecny == dependency on dependencies , a dependency tree on one another 
we have a package manager which makes our transitive dependencies works in an efficient mode, parcel also created a server for us 
app compatible with older browser == we have browser list which install parser for us 
will write browser list inside package.json == make compatible with other browsers by giving browserlist website link
// "last 2 version"  //app works on last two version 
to make a performant web scalable app =  so there are so many scalable things that react optimizes for us and many things that bundler gives us
