routerProvider to provide router to our app 
---------LET'S GET CLASSY-----------
class based component - only clas based component were use , no hooks no useState, painful to write class based code
later on - react team found that things were getting messy , which were even big and difficult 
no need to use class based component but we can encounter project having class based component and also asked in interviews     
use children of children to make more routes from the child element 
nned to create outlet in about section to make it available for the profile component as profile is the child of about 
----writing class based component------
making class based component in the react, 
use extends to inherit some properties in the class from the parent and render method is used to render some properties into the DOM 
----props in the classes-----
passing props in function by using props.name
props in class based component
---states in class components------
in class components class has a constructor  , constructor in class takes in props and we use super(props) 
constructor is a place used for initialization, whenever a class in invoked a constructor is called which is the best place to create a state variable 
react gives us access to this.state 
in functional component we can create two variable using useState but in functions states are created as a part of only one object 
------react lifecycle-
in lifecycle first the constructor is called then the render 
-----api calling------
in function = we use useEffect to call an api rendering two times , first render . then call data. then rerender 
in classes = we have constructor, we have render and we have componentdidMount (componentdidMount will be called after my render)
lifecycle methods - first constructor is called, then component renders and after that componentDidMount is called
