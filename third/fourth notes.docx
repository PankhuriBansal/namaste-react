polyfills are code which is  replacement of newer version of code , array.map() == pollyfill method 
babel converts newer code to older code 
babel is just like a library or package which is taking some code and giving out some code 
git init makes our repo compatible with git so we get gitignore in our application
to run command in an easy way we can write a script in package.json == "start": "parcel index.html"
install babel-plugin-transform-remove-console = removes our console.log from the program
version will go in package.json and original code will go into node modules
to use babel we need to configure it == so will create .babelrc for configuration in the whole project 
when we multiple children in an html tag which are known as siblings so we always need to give them keys
to declare keys in react we will write it in div object which is called props 
whenever i have array to render i need to give keys to my children
keys can be anything which uniquly identifies it
adding key will remove all our warnings 
we need to add keys to inject particular change in the DOM without changing very much but only the particular change 
we give keys by passing it as props and should never have same keys for two objects 
---------------------createElement--------------------
react.createElement is giving us an object and object is converted to html code which is then send up on DOM 
------------------------------------
JSX = assume it is js xml , needed to update html using js  
it is an html like syntax in javascript, fb developers built jsx 
jsx uses react.createElement which makes object and create html (dom) == babel understands jsx and converts into object code
advantages of jsx = readability, developers friendly 
--------------
babel ompiler for next generation js , babel another js library which reads our code and gives normal code 
babel geenrates AST (asyntax abstract tree) 
babel comes along with parcel
---------------------
React Components == 
1. functional Component = new way of writing = a piece of js function which returning react element 
2. class based Component = old way 
name of compoenet starts with capital letter = not mandatory but good to use 
functional component is a normal function 
we need to wrap the functional component using the paranthesis 
to use the react element in the functional component we directly write react element in the functional component or we can also use the {function_name} in the functional component 
if we make the react element as a function then we will use it in form of tags = <function_name/> or {function_name()}
we can write any piece of js code inside functional component just using {}
if i have an api call and we are getting data from the api 
if we are able to run the js piece of code in other's system so we get everything about that system but jsx is very secured and takes care it will escape any kind of hacking
jsx also sanitizes whatever we give it 
component composition or composing components = if we need to use component inside a component
